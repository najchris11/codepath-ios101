## App Brainstorming

- Apple Maps: Fluid design, and simple in terms of where you find UI.
- Apollo for Reddit: Good usage of haptics and user feedback materials, simple design
- Apple Wallet: UI for Apple Card looks great and gives you all your info at a glance, great use of space.

### App Idea

I'd like to make a retainer tracking/incentive app. It's a project I've been meaning to do for years, and I started it in Xamarin.Forms, but never had a chance to finish it.
